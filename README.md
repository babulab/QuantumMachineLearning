# Quantum Machine Learning


##  Overview
This repository showcases the application of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) to traditional machine learning tasks, such as classification and regression. The purpose is twofold:

The goal of this repository is twofold:
- To explore and advance understanding in state-of-the-art Quantum Machine Learning techniques.
- To demonstrate my expertise in Quantum Machine Learning as a foundation for future career opportunities.

## Current Work


This repository currently includes the following areas of focus:

- Classification:
    - Implementations include multiclass classification models using both fully quantum classifiers and hybrid quantum-classical models.
- Regression:
    - We explore quantum algorithms for regression using classical datasets, with implementations of both fully quantum and hybrid quantum-classical regressors.


## Future Updates 

Planned additions and improvements include:

- Development of QML algorithms focused on Natural Language Processing (NLP).
- Exploration and implementation of Quantum Reinforcement Learning models.
- Performance Evaluation: Comparative analysis of quantum versus classical algorithms to assess potential advantages in terms of accuracy, computational complexity, and scalability.
