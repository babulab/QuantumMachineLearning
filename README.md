# Quantitative Finance with Machine Learning


##  Overview
This repository demonstrates the application of advanced Machine Learning (ML) techniques in the field of Quantitative Finance. It showcases a variety of ML-driven approaches to key financial tasks, aiming to solve complex problems while improving decision-making processes in areas like portfolio optimisation and financial forecasting.

The goal of this repository is twofold:
- To explore state-of-the-art ML algorithms in Quantitative Finance.
- To serve as a demonstration of my expertise for future career opportunities in the finance and data science sectors.

## Current Work


For now, this repository currently includes two main areas of focus:

- Portfolio Optimisation:
    - Implementations include classic optimisation algorithms as well as Monte Carlo simulations to optimise portfolio returns.
- Financial Forecasting:
    - This section focuses on time series forecasting for stock prices, using multivariate, feature engineering and with easy adaptability to predict other financial instruments such as indices, commodities, ETFs, etc.
    - Models used include cutting-edge approaches like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Transformer models, and state-of-the-art transfer learning architectures, such as Chronos, a breakthrough model introduced by Amazon in 2024, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for time series predictions.


## Future Updates 

Several planned improvements and additions to this repository include:

- Advanced Optimisation Techniques:
    - Ongoing work on incorporating Reinforcement Learning and Bayesian Optimisation to further enhance portfolio optimisation methods.

- Expanding ML Use Cases:
    - Introducing new machine learning tasks that address other crucial problems in Quantitative Finance.

- Quantum Computing Applications:
    - Integrating Quantum Computing methods to tackle the presented tasks with higher efficiency. This is an area where I have substantial interest and experience. (For more, I encourage you to explore my other repositories on Quantum Computing.)
