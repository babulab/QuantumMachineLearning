# Quantum Machine Learning


##  Overview
This repository showcases the application of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) to traditional machine learning tasks, such as classification regression, and optimisation. The purpose is twofold:

The goal of this repository is twofold:
- To explore and advance understanding in state-of-the-art Quantum Machine Learning techniques.
- To demonstrate my expertise in Quantum Machine Learning as a foundation for future career opportunities.

## Current Work


This repository currently includes the following areas of focus:

- Classification: Implementations include multiclass classification models utilising:
    - Hybrid Models: Deep neural networks combined with quantum neural networks.
    - Fully Quantum Models: Quantum neural networks designed for classification tasks.
    - Quantum Support Vector Machines: Models based on quantum support vector machine techniques.

- Regression: We investigate quantum algorithms for regression tasks using classical datasets, featuring implementations of:
    - Hybrid Models: Deep neural networks paired with quantum neural networks.
    - Fully Quantum Models: Quantum neural networks tailored for regression.
    -  Quantum Support Vector Machines: Regression models based on quantum support vector machine approaches.


- Optimisation Techniques:
    - Quantum Bayesian Optimization, specifically employing Quantum Gaussian Processes to enhance optimization strategies.



## Future Updates 

Planned additions and improvements include:

- Development of QML algorithms focused on Natural Language Processing (NLP).
- Exploration and implementation of Quantum Reinforcement Learning models.
- Performance Evaluation: Comparative analysis of quantum versus classical algorithms to assess potential advantages in terms of accuracy, computational complexity, and scalability.

### Disclaimer
Due to the rapid evolution of the Qiskit framework, some parts of this repository may become incompatible in the future. I am actively working on updates, but there may be occasional delays in implementation.
